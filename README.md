# Employee Directory
 Techdegree Unit 5 Project

**Purpose:** 
    This project was created to demonstrate foundational concepts in public API requests. I fetched data from a random user site to generate 12 employees with US nationality. When users click on the employees cards a modal pop-up with more information appears. This is the final project for Unit 5 of the Treehouse Techdegree.

**Challenges:**
    My DOM manipulation skills were put to the test while making the modal pagination buttons. I learned about the importance of testing as move through the program, as well as understanding the program and the order the the code is being run.  

**Future Considerations:**
    I would love to figure out how to loop through the users for the modal popup.
